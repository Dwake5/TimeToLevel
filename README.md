# TimeToLevel

This code tells you how long until a certain condition is met in a game.

Rivals are leveled up by masters, of which there are three, in no order.

The rival needs level*10+10 exp to level up. 

They get each (master lvl - rival lvl) exp per min if greater than zero or zero otherwise.

How long will it take for a rival to reach each masters level or a set target level?

Four inputs will return 1-3 outputs for how long it takes to get to each masters level.

Five inputs will return how long it takes to reach that target.

I posted it to the relevant forum and explained step by step how non-coders could use it. Because it has a highly desired output.
